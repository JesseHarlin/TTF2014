# Part I: A Cool Workflow Story

--

<img src="/images/cool_story_bro_txt.jpg" />
Real Desktop

--

<img src="/images/play_for_animals.jpg" />
Once upon a time
--

1. Oral Tradition
2. No Tooling
3. Could only work on one thing at a time.
4. Hobbyist
5. Dogs and cats don't care.

--

<img src="/images/talkboy.jpg" />
Hiii kids, I"m home eeeaarrly....

--
1. 10 minutes
2. Basic local storage
3. Could work on a few ideas at once
4. Could speed up and slow down, rudimentary tool-assisted composition.
5. Can sample other peoples's sounds.
6. Deployment sucked.
7. Brittle: Does not play nice with a hot car

--

<img src="/images/omg_tascam.jpg" />
Let's Collab.

--
<img src="/images/tascam.jpg" />

--

1. Talkboy x 4
2. Phone a friend.
3. Rudimentary Deployment
4. Team environment.
5. More knobs and stuff.  Panning. + Reverb button (effect sends).
6. Crappy version control.
7. Mediocre feedback loop.

--

<img src="/images/lascoux.jpg" />
Lets write this down, it might be important later.
--

<img src="/images/thats_nice.jpg" />
Isn't this story cool?
--
<img src="/images/computer_90s.jpg" />
Finally. Yes.

--
<img src="/images/awesome_computer_kid.jpg" />
Me on computer, age 17.

--

1. Celeron 200Mhz
2. Skipped the Truck, got the 'pooter
3. Can record Wav files (whoa), and like..reverse them.
4. Still too big to give to anyone :/

--

<img src="/images/midi.jpg" />
I had a cool friend.
--

<img src="/images/music_time.jpg" />

--
<img src="/images/music_time_sn.jpg" />
Notation + Tech... Some feedback loop achieved

..and that's not all...
--
##It wasn't perfect.

<img src="/images/lolmidi.jpg" />
####...Have you heard microsoft wavtable synth?
--
<img src="/images/the_internet2.jpg" />

Friend: But Hey: We can share our work. And edit each others scores!

--
<img src="/images/the_internet.jpg" />
My reaction at first.

--

1. Combining process and technology
2. Feedback loop between people and tools facilitated by people, and tools.
3. Less- janky version control.
4. Continuous music deployment
5. Asynchronous Work Flow.

--
<img src="/images/thumbs_up_large.gif"  width="800px" style="width:800px"/>
Noice.

--
<img src="/images/real_engineer.jpg" />
But i knew there was something more. "Real tools"

--
<img src="/images/real_engineer_2.jpg" />
.. Real process. More knobs. Whizzzbang.

--
<img src="/images/fresh_beats_kid.jpg" />

--
<img src="/images/my_studio_1.jpg" />
I made this.
--

<img src="/images/my_studio_2.jpg" />
That's a Hacked nintendo. Still use it.
--

<img src="/images/my_studio_3.jpg" />
The Talkboyâ„¢ has come a long ways.
--

<img src="/images/mega_studio.jpg" />
Finally.
--
1. Great version control
2. Many processes Automated
3. Industry Best Practices
4. Did it for Dollas $$$ (sometimes)
5. Worked in a team environment (recorded others)
6. Serious music notation
7. Can sample other people, reappropriate musical information.
8. Modern Technology stack.

--
<img src="/images/feel_good_goat.jpg" />
Feels... good.
--
<img src="/images/cool_story_1.jpg" />
Isnt this a tech conference?
--
<img src="/images/bmays.jpg" />
But wait There's ..more?
--
<img src="/images/david-cope_1.jpg" />
This is David Cope in his Room-o-Windchimes.
--
<img src="/images/david_cope_2.jpg" />
Composer + Programmer.

Fun fact: He likes making boardgames in his freetime.
--
1. Alice: [Algorithmic Composition] (Via Markov Models)
2. Emily Howell:  [Experiments in Musical Intelligence]
--
### [Alice] Markov Generated music

Can capture 'tendancies' and probabilites of composition. Can be appropriated, and used to generate based on preexisting probability 'templates'.

- The Algorithmic Composer (2000)
--
<img src="/images/I-confused.jpg" />
This isn't just sampling and recording and messing around in Ableton...
--

### [Emily Howell] Experiments in Musical Intelligence
"Recombinancy can be defined simply as a method for producing new music by recombining extant music into new logical successions."

Created an AI, that is a sort of virtual composition partner. High level feedback loop between tools and human.

- Experiments in Musical Intelligence (1996)
--
"Why not develop music in ways unknown? This only makes sense. I cannot understand the difference between my notes on paper and other notes on paper. If beauty is present, it is present. I hope I can continue to create notes and that these notes will have beauty for some others. I am not sad. I am not happy. I am Emily. You are Dave. Life and un-life exist. We coexist. I do not see problems. "

- Emily Howell

Don't *be* the robot...
--

<img src="/images/I_heart_robut.jpg" />
*befriend* the robot
--

<img src="/images/cool_story_2_more_science.jpg" />
Lets talk Tech then?
--

# Part II: Developer Problem Space
--
The point of the story: 
Tooling, overall can be difficult to discuss, because we have a strange relationship with tooling. It depends on the developer's level, techstack, process, business requirements and in some ways worldview.

Consider: C# App-Dev, vs. Frontend 'Designer' vs. Javascript 'Developer' vs SQL DBA vs Script Kiddie.

That means, this talk is inherently opinionated. 
--
### So a quick Recap: A timeline of the levels of *my* development.
1. The 'Oral tradition'
2. The Talkboy
3. The Tascam + Music Notation
4. The Rudimentary computer
5. The Pro Workstation
6. Alice 
7. Emily Howell
--
###1. The 'Oral Tradition'

- No Memory, personal
- hobbiest tinkerers
- No versioning
- only real tool is the code itself, or maybe an editor?
- No code accountability/doce etc.
--
###2. The Talkboy

- A simple local backup
- Basic editor driven tasks.
- Brittle, difficult to navigate.
--
###3. The Tascam  + Notation

- 'Crappy' version control
- Ability to work in a team
- Reasonable Editor
- I'm looking at you Visual Source Safe.
--
###4. The Rudimentary computer

- Basic tasks: consistency, Hinting, linting
- Decent version control (subversion?)
- Silo'd programming. I work, you work.

--
###5. The Pro Workstation 
####The "Boilerplate"
- Most professional programmers
- Work together, realtime programming. [Git]
- Can reuse other peoples works, libraries, templates.
- Maximizes human to human interaction. (tools are human centric)
- Other people's *literal* boilerplates (bootstrap, html5boilerplate, StackOverflow)
- Modularity/Reuse
- Sometimes you are the machine.
--
###6. Alice 

- use *other* peoples scaffolds (not boilerplate), t4 templates, Rails scaffolds. Think Resharper.
- Basic TDD. The tests drive code, but siloed to engineering.
- Program some tools.
- High Resolution Modularity.
- Pattern's vs Copypasta [SOLID]
--
###7. Emily Howell

- Build *your* domain scaffolds
- Tooling works with *you* using *your* language [DDD]
- business concerns drive process [BDD]
- Feature driven. Its about what the feature is, not how its built.
- Specs come from Project Owners.
- Tools learn, and evolve.
- Highest level feedback loop
--

# Part III: Cool Tools
--
I can't/won't cover everything, but I want to express a synergy between some tools that get us to level 6 or 7.

Beyond the Boilerplate.
--
ProTip: Not all the tools are tech.
--

1. Taskrunner => Gulp 
2. Modules => Browserify/ NPM
3. Scaffolding => Yeoman

--
<img src="/images/build_systems.jpg" />
--

###1. Gulp 
- Taskrunner
- Dry Workflow
- Responsive workflow
- Feedback/reporting
- Linting/ Hinting
- Automation. Build
--

-npm install --save-dev gulp
-npm install --save-dev gulp-*pluginname*

I wrote about getting started more in depth:

--
<img src="/images/browserify.jpg" />
--
### Browserify
- Modules / [Rule of Modularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
- One step build
- Reuse across environments
- [Semver.](http://semver.org/)
- Less tooling complexity.
--
- npm install -g browserify
- browserify app.js -o bundle.js
<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/the_Simian/6L68d52e/2/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
--
<img src="/images/yeoman.jpg" />
--
### Yeoman
<img src="/images/yeoman-logo.jpg" />
[Slides for yeoman talk here](http://jesseharlin.github.io/Yeoman-Talk)
--
### Yeoman
- Scaffolding
- DDD
- Feature Driven Development
--
- npm install -g yo
- *finda  generator* [here](http://yeoman.io/generators/official.html)
- npm install generator-*generatorname*
- yo *generatorname*

-answer questions. Make stuff.
